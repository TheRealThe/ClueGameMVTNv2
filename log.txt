    Hey grader, so for our selectNotVisitedRoomTarget test it fails once in awhile but that is beacuse i'm checking to make sure that after we leave the room we don't automatically go back to the room. of course it will go back into the room if it was chosen, but that is a random chance to do that. just though i would let you know.
